**Done: Linear Algebra**

1. Implement basic matrix operations:
   - Matrix addition/subtraction
   - Matrix multiplication
   - Matrix transposition
   - Vector dot product

**To-Do: Linear Algebra**
1. Implement basic matrix operations:
   - Scalar multiplication
   - Checking equality of matrices
   - Vector cross product
   - Vector scaling
   
2. Input validation:
   - Handle memory allocation failures and report errors appropriately
   - Check for compatibility of matrix sizes in operations

3. Implement additional matrix operations:
   - Matrix inversion
   - Row reduction

6. Implement error handling and exception handling:
   - Define error codes or exceptions for specific error scenarios
   - Provide meaningful error messages for easier debugging
